These scripts are used to generate an installer for the drivers and
programs that are useful in a Windows guest using oVirt. Currently this
includes spice-vdagent (for copy and paste support among lots of other
things), the QXL video driver, oVirt Guest Agent and the VirtIO-Win
drivers (which vdagent needs).
This script installs these progams/drivers and then makes sure they are
started up/picked up correctly by Windows.

This script needs to have the various binaries/drivers it will install
available, they are not included in this archive. The various 'File'
directives in ovirt-guest-tools.nsis should give you an idea of the
directory tree the script expects.

To build the final installer, I'm using the mingw32-nsis package from
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MinGW/CrossCompilerFramework#Development_and_testing_repository
(but this should be available directly from the official Fedora
repositories starting with Fedora 17 or 18). Once this is installed, all
that is needed is to run makensis ./spice-guest-tools.nsi from your Linux
box, and magic will happen!
